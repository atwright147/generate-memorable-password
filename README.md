# Memorable Password Generator

Currently not very secure; however, it dose generate some pretty neat passwords.

## Usage

```
const generateMemorablePassword = require('generate-memorable-password');
generateMemorablePassword(); // granite-extensible-nugget-6769
generateMemorablePassword(); // concerned-sleek-towels-5333
```

## Current wordlist sizes:

* **Adjectives** - 1271
* **Nouns** - 1501

## Generation algorithm

Uses NodeJS' `crypto` to get random bytes. Combines two adjectives and a noun (in that order), and then a random number between (and including) 1000 and 9999.

**Current number of possibilities:** 1271 &times; 1271 &times; 1501 &times; 9000 = 21822992469000, or approximately 2<sup>44.31</sup>. Nowhere near 128-bit secure (just yet), but more for generating temporary passwords (**that expire soon, mind you**), or maybe for fun name generators.

This library focuses more on fun word combinations than actual secure passwords. If you want real, secure strings, you're probably looking in the wrong place.

Feel free to add more words to either list. **I do like food, and would appreciate a longer (or better curated) list of foods.** ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
